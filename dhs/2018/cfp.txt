                          DHS  2018
                  International Workshop on
      Methods and Tools for Distributed Hybrid Systems

             Ecole polytechnique, Paris, France
                         4 July 2018

The purpose of DHS is to connect researchers working in real-time and
hybrid systems, control theory, distributed computing, and concurrency,
in order to advance the subject of distributed hybrid systems.

Distributed hybrid systems, or distributed cyber-physical systems, are
abundant.  Many of them are safety-critical, but ensuring their correct
functioning is very difficult.  Convergence and interaction of methods
and tools from different areas of computer science, engineering, and
mathematics is needed in order to advance the subject.

This second edition of the DHS workshop aims at gathering researchers
which work in the above areas in order to facilitate collaboration and
discuss how the subject may advance.

We are calling for presentations of work which can highlight how the
research topics of DHS may interact in order to advance the subject of
distributed hybrid systems. Note that DHS 2018 will have no formal
proceedings.

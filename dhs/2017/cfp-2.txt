                   SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

                          DHS  2017
                  International Workshop on
      Methods and Tools for Distributed Hybrid Systems
                  Associated with MFCS 2017

                 Aalborg University, Denmark
                      25-26 August 2017

The deadline for submission has been extended to 20 June.


The purpose of DHS is to connect researchers working in real-time and
hybrid systems, control theory, distributed computing, and concurrency,
in order to advance the subject of distributed hybrid systems.

Distributed hybrid systems, or distributed cyber-physical systems, are
abundant.  Many of them are safety-critical, but ensuring their correct
functioning is very difficult.  We believe that new techniques are needed
for the analysis and validation of DHS.  More precisely, we believe that
convergence and interaction of methods and tools from different areas of
computer science, engineering, and mathematics is needed in order to
advance the subject.

This first edition of the DHS workshop aims at gathering researchers which
work in the above areas in order to facilitate collaboration and discuss
how the subject may advance.

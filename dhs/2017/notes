Budget:

M.Fränzle: Likely to go by car, 1200km.  (I hope we can reimburse this?) 700
€ plus hotel (2 nights) = 900 €

A.Abate: 400 € for a direct plane Gatwick--Aalborg plus hotel (3 nights) = 700 €

Kim will pay the registration fees for the invited speakers (and for me, I
hope), hence no further cost.

Altogether this makes 2300 €, c'est pas chêr 

Invited:

title: 

Verification and synthesis for heterogeneous systems encompassing learned and learning components

abstract: 

Modern complex engineering goals require complex models, such as
distributed hybrid systems and heterogeneous system architectures. In
view of recent data-driven technologies and data access capabilities,
models ought to encompass the presence of data-dependent,
learned or learning, and adaptive components. This results in a complex
networked model with black- or grey-box learning components, for
instance a networked control model with a DNN-enabled controller.  

This panel discusses approaches to verify such models, or to synthesise
control architectures abiding by network-level goals or requirements. We
solicit contributions and participation from experts in Rigorous
System Design (e.g., contract-based design), Formal Verification (e.g.,
assume-guarantee verification), Control Engineering (e.g., networked
control systems), as well as Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (e.g.,
multi-agent systems) and Machine Learning (e.g., deep neural nets).

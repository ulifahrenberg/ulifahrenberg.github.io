      <p>
	The purpose of DHS is to connect researchers working in <em>real-time systems</em>, <em>hybrid systems</em>, <em>control theory</em>, <em>distributed computing</em>, and <em>concurrency theory</em>, in order to advance the subject of <strong>distributed hybrid systems</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
	Distributed hybrid systems, or distributed <em>cyber-physical systems</em>, are abundant.  Many of them are safety-critical, but ensuring their correct functioning is very difficult.  We believe that new techniques are needed for the analysis and validation of DHS.  More precisely, we believe that convergence and interaction of methods and tools from different areas of computer science, engineering, and mathematics is needed in order to advance the subject.

	The <a href="2017/">first DHS workshop</a> was held in
	Aalborg, Denmark, in August 2017 and associated with
	<a href="http://mfcs2017.cs.aau.dk/">MFCS</a>.  It featured
	invited talks
	by <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/alessandro.abate/home.html">Alessandro
	Abate</a>, <a href="https://uol.de/hs/mitarbeiterinnen-und-mitarbeiter/prof-dr-martin-fraenzle/">Martin

      </p>

      <p>
	This third edition of DHS will add <strong>distributed
	robotics</strong> as a special theme.  This emerging field is
	concerned with the control of collaborative swarms of
	autonomous robots.  Some of our invited speakers will treat
	this subject both from a theoretical and a practical
	perspective, and we hope to install a conversation which will

      <!--
      <p>DHS 2019 will comprise a <em>panel session</em> under the
      theme <strong>Verification and synthesis for heterogeneous
      systems encompassing learned and learning
	  components</strong>.</p>

      <p>Modern complex engineering goals require complex models, such
	as distributed hybrid systems and heterogeneous system
	architectures. In view of recent data-driven technologies and
	data access capabilities, models ought to encompass the
	presence of data-dependent, learned or learning, and adaptive
	components. This results in a complex networked model with
	black- or grey-box learning components, for instance a
	networked control model with a DNN-enabled controller.</p>

      <p>This panel discusses approaches to verify such models, or to
	synthesise control architectures abiding by network-level
	goals or requirements. We solicit contributions and
	participation from experts in Rigorous System Design (e.g.,
	contract-based design), Formal Verification (e.g.,
	assume-guarantee verification), Control Engineering (e.g.,
	networked control systems), as well as Robotics and Artificial
	Intelligence (e.g., multi-agent systems) and Machine Learning
	(e.g., deep neural nets).</p>

		<br />In this talk, I will propose a design approach
		for interconnected control systems, in which the
		controllers are synthesized compositionally from
		high-level logic requirements in a push-button and
		formal manner. Examples of such requirements include
		those expressed as linear temporal logic (LTL)
		formulae. In particular, I will leverage decomposition
		and abstraction as two key tools to tackle the design
		complexity, by either breaking the design object into
		semi-independent parts or by aggregating components
		and eliminating unnecessary details. I will illustrate
		the effectiveness of the proposed results on some case
		studies. I will show that our proposed results can
		handle large-scale systems, which would not have been

	      <div id="mazogds" style="display:none">
		<br />Modern control systems are often implemented as
		networked systems, in which bandwidth of a
		communication medium is shared among a number of
		applications. Furthermore, often the act of
		communicating also has an energy impact on the system
		infrastructure, e.g. in the case of wireless control
		systems. In the last decade the study of controller
		implementation strategies aiming at reducing the
		communication footprint, to save bandwidth (and
		energy), has thus attracted great attention. Arguably,
		one of the most promising implementation paradigms in
		the literature is that of event-triggered control
		(ETC), in which communications are triggered by the
		state of the plant itself, which makes the system
		communicate only when necessary to retain stability of
		the closed- loop.  ETC implementations, while reducing
		drastically the amount of required bandwidth, result
		in aperiodic transmissions whose time of occurrence
		are highly unpredictable, leading to difficulties for
		scheduling such systems. Such difficulties usually
		imply that the freed bandwidth may not be reusable by
		other (real-time) applications, and that energy
		savings may be completely lost, thus rendering ETC
		schemes inefficient.<br />
		In this talk I’ll describe a possible solution to the
		ETC scheduling problem through the construction of
		timed-automata models for the ETC systems’ traffic. I
		will start introducing ETC and illustrating the impact
		of the problem on some examples from our experimental
		work. I will then introduce the notions of symbolic
		abstractions of control systems, simulation relations
		and timed-automata, and I’ll show how all of those
		come together in our approach to schedule ETC. I’ll
		finalize the talk describing our most recent advances
		on how to construct ETC traffic models, and the
		available tools to use them for controller scheduling.

		by benchmarks provided by our industry partner, we
		study a relational extension of dL, aiming to formally
		prove statements such as "an earlier deployment of the
		emergency brake decreases the collision speed." A main
		technical challenge here is to relate two states of
		two dynamics at different time points. Our main
		contribution is a theory of suitable relational
		differential invariants (a relational extension of
		differential invariants that are central proof methods
		in dL), and a derived technique of time
		stretching. The latter features particularly high
		applicability, since the user does not have to

		<br />Demographic and economic developments require
		more and more resources, but onshore possibilities are
		limited. Naturally, oceans, covering 72% of our
		planet, appear as the solution to provide food,
		minerals or energy. Most of countries consider these
		domains as a key for the future. For example, the
		European commission supports the "blue growth
		strategy" to develop high-potential sectors such as
		aquaculture, tourism, biotechnology, energy or seabed
		mining.<br />
		Most of the seas must still be considered unknown
		areas. The French oceanic institute (IFREMER) consider
		that only 10% of the sea bed is well known. Out of
		these areas lives a huge and quite unknown
		biodiversity (scientists estimate knowing only 24000
		species out of several millions – without
		bacteria). Most of these ecosystems live out of
		continental shelves, in more than 200m depth and their
		organization and equilibrium are poorly known.<br />
		Here appears the tremendous challenge to withdraw
		resources from this environment by preserving its
		environmental balances and the need for intensive
		exploration and monitoring solutions for these
		areas.<br />
		Access to the deep sea is extremely difficult, due to
		the complexity of high sea operation organization
		(distance from port, communications, cost, etc.) but
		also due to sea water specificity: no air, viscosity
		pressure, no magnetic waves... This has, up to now,
		prevented a complete exploration, but after pioneering
		ages, autonomous underwater robotics starts a
		revolution in the access to the abyss.<br />
		In this talk, we will see why and how people have
		continuously searched to go deeper and to last longer
		undersea. We will start from the early ages of
		assisted diving to offshore robotics for oil & gas
		deep seas operations and the latest developments in
		autonomous robot.  The end of the talk will deal with
		the future of underwater autonomous solutions into an
		exploration perspective and particularly on what
		coordinated distributed systems can provide to our
		ocean knowledge.

	      <div id="trannmxj" style="display:none">
		<br />Safety-critical distributed cyber-physical
		systems (CPSs) have been found in a wide range of
		applications. Notably, they have displayed a great
		deal of utility in intelligent transportation, where
		autonomous vehicles communicate and cooperate with
		each other via a high-speed communication
		network. Such systems require an ability to identify
		maneuvers in real-time that cause dangerous
		circumstances and ensure the implementation always
		meets safety-critical requirements. In this paper, we
		propose a real-time decentralized safety verification
		approach for a distributed multi-agent CPS with the
		underlying assumption that all agents are
		time-synchronized with a low degree of error. In the
		proposed approach, each agent periodically computes
		its local reachable set and exchanges this reachable
		set with the other agents with the goal of verifying
		the system safety. Our method, implemented in Java,
		takes advantages of the timing information and the
		reachable set information that are available in the
		exchanged messages to reason about the safety of the
		whole system in a decentralized manner. Any particular
		agent can also perform local safety verification tasks
		based on their local clocks by analyzing the messages
		it receives. We applied the proposed method to verify,
		in real-time, the safety properties of a group of
		quadcopters performing a distributed search mission.

		<br />Delays arise naturally in feedback loops in
		modern forms of embedded digital control, like
		networked control systems where communication between
		the plant and the controller is crucial. Especially
		when dealing with safety-critical systems, the
		communication delay in the feedback loop may however,
		become significant. In continuous control, delays are
		modeled by Delay Differential Equations (DDE) and it
		is already well-known that such delays may cause
		oscillations which directly affect the stability and
		control performance of the system. However, despite a
		large portion of digital control schemes being subject
		to hybrid state dynamics, there has not been much
		interest in considering delays in hybrid systems. To
		the best of our knowledge, neither an established
		notion of delayed hybrid system nor corresponding
		verification methods exist. Introducing a formal
		semantic, i.e., mathematical model for rigorously
		modeling delays arising in hybrid systems thus
		constitutes the main objective of this PhD
		project.<br />
		Currently, we are exploiting the idea of using
		distributed delays as a more relevant model and
		potentially easier to analyze compared to discrete
		delays. The smoothing effect embedded in distributed
		delays implies promising results in reconstructing the
		history segment based on finite samples. This approach
		ultimately leads to the reduction of a DDE problem to
		that of solving an, albeit higher-dimensional,
		standard ODE. Future work will exploit this reduction
		for automatic verification of hybrid systems

ABOUT

The purpose of DHS is to connect researchers working in real-time and
hybrid systems, control theory, distributed computing, and concurrency,
in order to advance the subject of distributed hybrid systems.

Distributed hybrid systems, or distributed cyber-physical systems, are
abundant.  Many of them are safety-critical, but ensuring their correct
functioning is very difficult.  Convergence and interaction of methods
and tools from different areas of computer science, engineering, and
mathematics is needed in order to advance the subject.

PROGRAM

The program comprises three invited talks, six contributed talks, and
a panel session:

 9:00  Invited talk: Majid Zamani, U Colorado, US
 
       Compositional synthesis of interconnected control systems

10:30  Timed automata as synchronization abstractions for aperiodic
       control systems

11:00  Relational differential dynamic logic

11:30  Invited talk: Herve de Forges, Kopadia, France

       Underwater robotics: past, present, and future

13:30  Hybrid active objects

14:00  Decentralized real-time safety verification for distributed
       cyber-physical systems

14:30  Delayed hybrid systems

15:30  Simulation of hybrid Reo connectors

16:00  Invited talk: Xavier Urbain, U Lyon 1, France

       Swarms of mobile robots, towards safety with versatility

17:00  Panel

       Verification and synthesis for heterogeneous systems
       encompassing learned and learning components

<h2>Sixth lecture</h2>

<p>Wednesday 9 April 2014, 8:00 to 10:00</p>

<p>Accessible online at: http://goo.gl/bdNxcR</p>

<p>The theme of this last TP is <em>Fun with model checking</em>...
<ol>
	<li>A farmer wants to cross a river in a little boat, together with her <em>dog</em>, her <em>goat</em>, and a <em>cabbage</em>.  The boat can only hold the farmer and <em>one</em> other thing (and the farmer does the rowing, so she needs to be in the boat for crossing the river).  Also, if left alone, the dog will scare away the goat, and the goat will eat the cabbage.<br />
	How can the farmer get all her things across the river, without the goat running away and without the cabbage being eaten?<br />
	Write a formal model of the system, using Spin or NuSMV, and use model checking to solve the puzzle.  (Hint: Make it so that your solution will be a <em>counter-example</em>.)</li>
	<li>Have a look at the Frog Puzzle at <a href="http://www.hellam.net/maths2000/frogs.html">http://www.hellam.net/maths2000/frogs.html</a>. Write a formal model of the puzzle (which works for an arbitrary number of frogs) and use model checking to solve it.  How many frog moves does the solution take?</li>
	<li>How many frogs can your model checker handle? Can you optimize it to handle more?</li>
	<li>At <a href="http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RushHourVideo.htm">http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RushHourVideo.htm</a> you will find the puzzle game <em>Rush Hour</em>.  Use model checking to solve a few of the puzzles at <a href="http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RHfromMarkRiedel/Jam.html">http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RHfromMarkRiedel/Jam.html</a>.</li>
	<li>Can you find solutions for Rush Hour puzzles which take as few steps as possible?</li>
	<li>(Difficult!) Now assume that the cars can move independently (in parallel), and use your model checker to find <em>fastest</em> solutions.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Homework update</h3>

<p>Note that this is also the last chance for you to get help from me with your exercises.
<ul>
	<li>Those of you who still struggle with exercise 6 of <a href="index03.html">the third lecture</a> may find some inspiration in <a href="dp-ts1.pml">dp-ts1.pml</a>.  This is my own solution to exercise 6.  You can use this file in two ways:
	<ul>
		<li>You can improve your own, maybe partially working, solution to exercise 6 by looking what I have done.</li>
		<li>Or, you can take my solution, consider exercise 6 to be solved, and move on with your life, to exercise 7.  <em>This will lose you one point.</em></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Regarding the homework of <a href="index05.html">yesterday</a>, I have received some wrong answers to question 6.  The right answer is "Nope, there's no LTL property which differentiates the two systems."  <strong>Why?</strong>  It is important that you understand the difference between linear time (LTL) and branching time (CTL).</li>
</ul></p>

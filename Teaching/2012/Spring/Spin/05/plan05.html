<h2>Fifth lecture</h2>

<p>Friday 23 March 2012, 16:15 to 18:15</p>

<p>Accessible online at: <strong>http://tiny.cc/iglmbw</strong></p>

<p>I have published some <a href="../04/sol04.html">solutions</a> to last lecture's exercises.</p>

<p>We will do some LTL model checking today.
<ol>
	<li>Open <a href="peterson.pml">peterson.pml</a>, my implementation of the Peterson mutual exclusion protocol.  I have annotated it with some Boolean variables which are used to signal that a process is in the critical section.<br />
We want to check mutual exclusion.  The Spin syntax for this property is <code>[] ( !c1 || !c2 )</code>.  JSpin has an input field "LTL formula"; enter it there.  Then click the "Translate" button.  What have you done?  Click "Verify".  How does Spin verify the formula?</li>
	<li>Be sure to understand precisely how LTL model checking is done in Spin.</li>
	<li>Check whether my Peterson implementation is <em>live</em> (every process enters its critical section infinitely often), and whether it is <em>starvation free</em>.  (For starvation freedom, you may have to annotate your model some more.)</li>
	<li>Do the same for your implementations of the other protocols which we discussed during <a href="../02/plan02.html">lecture 2</a>.</li>
	<li>Verify important properties of your (or <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/s4/people/ulrich.fahrenberg/Teaching/12/Spring/Spin/04/dp-ts3.pml">my</a>) model of the <em>dining philosophers</em>.  Use LTL formulas to see whether the system is deadlock-free, starvation-free, etc.</li>
</ol></p>

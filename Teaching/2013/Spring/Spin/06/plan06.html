<h2>Sixth and seventh lecture</h2>

<p>Friday 23 March 2012, 8:00 to 10:00 and 16:15 to 18:15</p>

<p>Accessible online at: <strong>http://tinyurl.com/cxcoto5</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> There's some suggestions for solutions in <a href="sol06.html">sol06.html</a></p>

<p>Theme of today's lectures: <em>Fun with Spin</em></p>

<p><ol>
    <li>A farmer wants to cross a river in a little boat, together with
      his <em>dog</em>, his <em>goat</em>, and a <em>cabbage</em>.  The
      boat can only hold the farmer and <em>one</em> other thing (and
      the farmer does the rowing, so she needs to be in the boat for
      crossing the river).  Also, if left alone, the dog will scare away
      the goat, and the goat will eat the cabbage.<br />  How can the
      farmer get all her things across the river, without the goat
      running away and without the cabbage being eaten?<br />  Write a
      Promela model of the system and use Spin to find a solution (if it
      exists).<br />
    <li>Have a look at the Frog Puzzle
      at <a href="http://www.hellam.net/maths2000/frogs.html">http://www.hellam.net/maths2000/frogs.html</a>.
      Write a Promela model of the puzzle (which works for an arbitrary
      number of frogs) and use Spin to solve it.  How many frog moves
      does the solution take?</li>
    <li>How many frogs can your Promela model handle? Can you optimize
      it to handle more?</li>
    <li>At <a href="http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RushHourVideo.htm">http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RushHourVideo.htm</a>
      you will find the puzzle game <em>Rush Hour</em>.  Model the game
      in Promela and use Spin to solve a few of the puzzles
      at <a href="http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RHfromMarkRiedel/Jam.html">http://www.puzzles.com/products/RushHour/RHfromMarkRiedel/Jam.html</a>.</li>
    <li>Can you find solutions for Rush Hour puzzles which take as few
    steps as possible? What if the cars can move independently (in
    parallel): can you find fastest solutions?</li>
</ol></p>

<p>These are also the <em>last two TP</em> for this course, so if you
  have any questions, any old exercises you need help with, anything:
  this is the last chance you have for asking.</p>

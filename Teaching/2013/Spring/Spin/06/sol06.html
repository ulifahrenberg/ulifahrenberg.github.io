<h2><a href="plan06.html">Sixth and seventh lecture</a>: Some solutions</h2>

<p>Friday 23 March 2012, 8:00 to 10:00 and 16:15 to 18:15</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>You can find a suggestion for solving the Boat Problem in <a href="boat.pml">boat.pml</a>.  This is incomplete, but probably needs only a bit of <code>atomic</code> magic to be made to work.</li>
	<li>A complete solution to the Frog Puzzle is in <a href="frogs.pml">frogs.pml</a>.  On my machine it can handle up to 16 frogs on each side, and 17 with a <code>pan</code> recompilation.  Note the simplicity of the solution: It's running independent <code>move</code> and <code>jump</code> processes for every field of the pond which continuously check whether they can operate.</li>
	<li>No, there is no solution here for the Rush Hour puzzle.</li>
</ul></p>
